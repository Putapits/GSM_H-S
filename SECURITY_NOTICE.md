# üîí SECURITY NOTICE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your codebase previously contained **hardcoded sensitive credentials** that may have been exposed:

### Exposed Credentials (Now Removed from Code)

1. **Gmail Account**: `santos.peterjames.divinagracia@gmail.com`
2. **Gmail App Password**: `wlouwvjbzzjsljwn`
3. **Database Configuration**: Hardcoded in `include/database.php`

## What We've Done

‚úÖ **Removed all hardcoded credentials** from source code
‚úÖ **Created secure configuration system** using environment variables
‚úÖ **Updated `.gitignore`** to prevent future credential leaks
‚úÖ **Created deployment documentation** with security best practices

## What You MUST Do Now

### 1. Revoke Exposed Gmail App Password (URGENT)

The Gmail app password `wlouwvjbzzjsljwn` was exposed in your code. You must:

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Find and **REVOKE** the exposed app password
3. Generate a **NEW** app password
4. Update `config/.env` with the new password

### 2. Create Your Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp config/.env.example config/.env

# Edit config/.env and add your NEW credentials
# NEVER commit this file to Git!
```

### 3. Update All Credentials

Edit `config/.env` with:
- New Gmail app password
- Database credentials
- Any other sensitive configuration

### 4. Verify Git Protection

Check that sensitive files are ignored:

```bash
git status
# config/.env should NOT appear in the list
```

### 5. Clean Git History (If Already Pushed)

If you've already pushed code with credentials to a repository:

**Option A: Private Repository**
- Rotate all exposed credentials immediately
- Consider the old credentials compromised

**Option B: Public Repository**
- **URGENT**: Rotate ALL credentials immediately
- Consider using tools like `git-filter-repo` to remove sensitive data from history
- Force push cleaned history (breaks existing clones)
- Notify all collaborators

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Store credentials in `config/.env` (never commit this file)
- Use environment variables on production servers
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable 2FA on all accounts
- Review code before committing

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Hardcode credentials in source code
- Commit `.env` files to Git
- Share credentials in chat/email
- Use the same password across services
- Ignore security warnings

## Files Now Protected

- `config/.env` - Your actual credentials (Git ignored)
- `config/.env.example` - Template only (safe to commit)
- `config/config.php` - Secure loader (safe to commit)

## Verification

After setup, verify security:

```bash
# This should show NO sensitive files
git status

# This should show config/.env is ignored
git check-ignore config/.env
```

## Questions?

If you're unsure about any security aspect, **STOP** and seek help before proceeding with deployment.
